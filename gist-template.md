# Title (replace with your title)

This tutorial will explain to the reader what the "Regex" or regular expression for a phone number extraction is and break down each part describing what it does.

## Summary

To put it briefly, we're breaking down the sections of a crazy looking snippet of code called a Regex.  Pretty much, someone figured out there's patterns all over the place out there and you can program those patterns into a computer so that a large complex pattern can be found and described by entering a code or Regex. Using the example of a phone number extractor the code '\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}' searches for patterns where there are 3 digits a dash "-" another 3 digits, a dash followed by 4 digits: "XXX-XXX-XXXX" where X is any integer from 0-9.
